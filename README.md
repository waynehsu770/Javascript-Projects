This project is a standard pizza menu with different customization choices. It then takes in all the information and calculates the price of the order.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game ###
This project randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players has the first move and then proceeds just like the classic game. 

### Calculator ###
This is a basic 4 function calculator with additio, subtraction, multiplication and division.
